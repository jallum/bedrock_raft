defmodule Bedrock.Raft.Mode.Follower do
  @moduledoc """
  The Follower state of the RAFT protocol. This is the state that a node is in
  when it is not the leader, and is waiting for a leader to emerge, but has not
  yet decided to stand as a candidate for election itself.

  These are the key characteristics of this phase:

  - Passivity: Followers are mostly passive. They don't issue requests on
    their own but respond to requests from leaders and candidates.

  - Responding to Leaders: When a follower receives a heartbeat (a signal to
    prevent election timeouts) or data from the current leader, it updates its
    internal state and then responds to the leader’s requests.

  - Election Timeout: Each follower has an election timeout. If a follower
    doesn't hear from a leader before this timeout, it assumes there is no
    current leader and indicates that a transition to the Candidate state is
    necessary to start an election.

  - Log Replication: Followers receive log entries from the leader. They append
    these entries to their log and return acknowledgment to the leader.

  - Committing Entries: Once a log entry is safely replicated, the leader
    informs the followers to commit the entry. The followers then apply the
    entry to their local state machines.

  - Consistency Check: If there's a discrepancy in the log entries between a
    leader and a follower, the follower rejects the new entries. The leader
    then works to bring the follower's log into consistency with its own.
